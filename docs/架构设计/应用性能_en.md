# Architecture · Application Performance

## Design Intent

APM should not be a burden for ops teams — **minimal architecture, full features, works out of the box**.

---

## Three Core Components

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Ingest<br/>Collect"] --> B["Storage<br/>Persist"] --> C["Platform<br/>Visualize"]
```

| Component | Responsibility | Why this design |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Ingest** | Receive traces and metrics from applications | Data entry only — lightweight and efficient |
| **Storage** | Unified storage for all observability data | One engine — no multiple databases |
| **Platform** | Query, visualization, alerting, AI | All capabilities in one service |

**vs traditional APM**: Often Elasticsearch + Kafka + many microservices + complex config. DataBuff runs everything with **3 containers**.

## Full Data Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  App["Your application"] -->|"OTel standard"| Ingest["Ingest layer"]
  Ingest -->|"Trace assembly"| Trace["Full call chain"]
  Ingest -->|"Minute-level aggregation"| Metric["Service metrics"]
  Trace & Metric --> Store["Unified storage"]
  Store --> UI["Troubleshooting · Traces · Metrics · Topology"]
  Store --> AI["AI platform reads directly"]
```

### Key Design Choices

| Design | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **OTel standard ingestion** | Not tied to a specific agent; ecosystem-friendly |
| **Automatic trace assembly** | Distributed fragments become full chains — no app changes |
| **Metrics derived from traces** | One data source, two uses — lower collection cost |
| **Minute-level pre-aggregation** | Fast queries, efficient storage, efficient alert evaluation |

---

## Value of Minimal Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph traditional["Traditional APM"]
    T1["10+ components"]
    T2["High ops cost"]
    T3["Heavy resources"]
  end
  subgraph databuff["DataBuff"]
    D1["3 components"]
    D2["One-command deploy"]
    D3["Runs on a single machine"]
  end
```

| | Traditional APM | DataBuff |
|--|-----------------|----------|
| Components | 10+ | **3** |
| Minimum resources | 16GB+ RAM | **8GB workable** |
| Time to value | Days | **Minutes** |
| Ops staff | Dedicated team | **Dev self-service** |

**Minimal does not mean bare-bones** — troubleshooting, tracing, service metrics, topology, and alert evaluation are all covered in Phase 1.

---

## Relationship with AI

Another benefit of minimal APM architecture: **AI's data path is minimal too**.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Store["Unified storage"] --> Tools["AI tool layer"]
  Tools --> Experts["Digital experts"]
```

No multi-source stitching or cross-system queries — AI experts reach metrics, traces, topology, and alerts through one storage entry. That is the engineering foundation of AI-native OpenTelemetry APM.
